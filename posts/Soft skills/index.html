One of the most underestimated aspects of making progress in one's career are definitely soft skills. When one starts working in bigger teams, communication skills are the first thing that is exposed about every developer. Evaluating someone's technical skills takes time, but a meeting or discussion is more than enough to "feel" someone as a person. If you don't present yourself in the best light, especially early in your career, you could lose a lot. Even during the interview process, if we are talking about serious companies, your soft skills are put to the test right away . Since the first round of talks is usually with one of the company's HR representatives, you can expect different kinds of questions which they use to learn a lot about you.</p><h2>Overall manners</h2><p>Manners are extremely important for leaving a good first impression so my advice is to show up dressed up and to talk with poise. Having a developed vocabulary, the result of reading books in English or your native language, depending on the situation, is one thing that helped me when it comes to learning good manners in general.</p><h2>Empathy</h2><p>Almost certainly, one of the questions you will be asked will try to evaluate your <strong>empathy</strong> level. What is empathy?</p><blockquote><p><strong>Empathy is one's ability to understand and share the feelings of another.</strong></p></blockquote><p>Even though we work with machines all the time, humans are not machines. Pressure, tight deadlines and overall life stress can influence performance of you or your peers. Example of a question that is related to empathy is something like:</p><blockquote><p><strong>How do you act if you don't like the idea that another teammate is proposing?</strong></p></blockquote><p>If you don’t like someone’s idea, make sure you understand why and make sure that you have concrete reasons why. Even better, if you know what is a problem, try to propose a solution in the form of positive feedback. Start off by saying something positive about their suggestion, then what you don’t like, and finish off on another positive. When it comes to programming there is no best option, every decision is a trade-off. Never forget that. If you are disagreeing, it's very important to accentuate positives about their idea. When it comes to finishing on a positive note, try presenting your idea and making a fusion between existing and proposed, in a way that everyone is satisfied. In no way don't just propose your solution, say it's better and make others adopt it. It undermines other people's work and confidence.</p><h2>Communication</h2><p>As your team grows and differentiates, good communication becomes a key for As your team grows and differentiates, good communication becomes the key for keeping the team in harmony. What is important is to understand that no one is there to undermine your work, but to try and bring the best out of everyone. If that's not the case, it's time for you to change your workplace. It's very important to leave your ego at the door and not take anything personally.</p><p>A few key things for good communication:</p><ul><li><strong>Speak clearly and with confidence.</strong> If you are speaking in this way, it ensures everyone will listen to what you are saying. Always be vocal in meetings and make your presence felt, but don't just say something for sake of saying. Speak to <strong>bring value</strong>.</li><li><strong>Listen.</strong></li><li><strong>Never interrupt others.</strong></li></ul><p>Even though some of these are obvious, if discussion gets heated and you get carried away by emotions, it's very important to remember to <strong>always show respect</strong>.</p><h2>Approachability and helpfulness</h2><p>As you make progress in your career and at the workplace, you become more and more familiar with how things work in the company. When someone new joins your team, they will ask you something sooner or later.</p><p>If people don't feel comfortable approaching you and discussing stuff, even when it's a problem, only one thing can happen. Problems will keep getting bigger, until someone can't take it anymore and it could become unsolvable. Also, if this is the case, you are a lot less likely to get help when you need it.</p><h2>Accountability</h2><p>Accountability is taking ownership of your mistakes. Everyone makes them and it is very important to take responsibility and find a way to fix them. You are more than likely to be in a similar position throughout your career and you don't want to make the same mistake multiple times.</p><p>It's sometimes really hard to raise your hand and admit you made a mistake, but in the long term you will be a lot more appreciated and have a lot more benefits. If you made a call, embrace the results.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>To be honest, the first time I was hired, it happened because of my attitude and because I was being open minded and more than willing to take on a challenge. Soft skills matter at every point in your career. There are many developers who have extremely developed technical skills, but due to lack of soft skills their career progress is way slower than it could be. Never underestimate the power of relationships, emotions and the impression you leave</p></div><footer><div class="container-md px-3 my-5 markdown-body"><div class="d-flex flex-justify-center"><p class="text-small text-gray v-align-middle">Styled with <a href="https://primer.style">Primer</a> | Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a> | Hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a></p></div></div></footer></body></html>
