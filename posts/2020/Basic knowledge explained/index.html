So first, let's try to understand how the process of achieving required knowledge works :</p><img src="/images/beginningflow.png" alt="Competitive advantage flow"/><p>This one is pretty straightforward. The hard thing is <strong>how</strong>. Since requirement for achieving <strong>competitive advantage</strong> is having overall knowledge posses by most beginners I will try to explain my perception on basic knowledge.</p><p>When it comes to programming, <strong>basic knowledge</strong> includes :</p><ol><li>Variables, constants, data types</li><li>Flow control, functions</li><li>Objects and structures</li><li>Programming language syntax</li><li>Additional tools</li></ol><p>When it comes to iOS and Swift, no source is as reliable as Apple documentation. Overall, before starting anything, I advise trying to understand basic concepts of <em>object-oriented programming</em>. For understaning OOP consepts in depth I recommend this Stanford <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMDCCdjyW8&list=PL47E7E3E9C3580684">course</a> which is free and available on youtube. Understanding OOP, even though it seems irrelevant at the beginning, will actually make your learning curve a lot less steep. I made this mistake, and I still regret it.</p><p>All above stated topics for iOS development are covered on Swift's <a href="https://swift.org">official website</a>.</p><p>After reading through the basic stuff, I would recommend using new app made by Apple which is super cool for learning basics. This app ,called <strong><a href="https://apps.apple.com/de/app/swift-playgrounds/id1496833156?l=en&mt=12">Swift Playgrounds</a></strong>, is available through the App Store and uses <em>games</em> as a form of education for basic topics stated above. It requires no prior programming knowledge, so it si perfect for people just starting out.</p><p>In case you posses the basic knowledge, I highly recommend the <em><a href=" /posts/2020/Achieve%20competitive%20knowledge%20Roadmap/">Achieve competitive advantage roadmap</a></em> to start creating difference between you and others on the same path.</p></div><footer><div class="container-md px-3 my-5 markdown-body"><div class="d-flex flex-justify-center"><p class="text-small text-gray v-align-middle">Styled with <a href="https://primer.style">Primer</a> | Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a> | Hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a></p></div></div></footer></body></html>
