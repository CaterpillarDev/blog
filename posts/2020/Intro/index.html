A term first defined by <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter">Michael Porter</a></em>, could be summed up in a sentence:</p><blockquote><p>Sustainable competitive advantages are assets, attributes, or abilities that are difficult to duplicate or exceed; and provide a superior or favorable long term position over competitors.</p></blockquote><p>And as a developer, even though tech is currently one of the most deficient skills one can possess, having basic knowledge often simply isn't enough to get the position you want, especially not in a top tier company in a big market. That's where the gap between the current school system and actual market needs is obvious. That's why having understanding of topics like:</p><blockquote><p>design patterns <br> software architectures <br> basic and advanced security principles <br> programming paradigms <br> deeper platform-specific knowledge</p></blockquote><p>comes into play. Possessing skills such as these, could be a difference between getting a life changing job or not. Coming from a small environment, with relatively undeveloped tech market, it was really hard acquiring knowledge necessary to move to a big market and work in one of the most security demanding areas of tech, which is eHealth .<br>That's why the purpose of this blog is explaining knowledge on the above stated topics, which helped me transition to German market . No knowledge is perfect and finite but I will do my best to bring value, by going through new challenges, and documenting all improvements and sharing the actual knowledge gained here.</p></div><footer><div class="container-md px-3 my-5 markdown-body"><div class="d-flex flex-justify-center"><p class="text-small text-gray v-align-middle">Styled with <a href="https://primer.style">Primer</a> | Generated using <a href="https://github.com/johnsundell/publish">Publish</a> | Hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a></p></div></div></footer></body></html>
