# Intro 



As this is my first post, I would like to headline my perspective on __`sustainable competitive advantage`__ in tech and how one can actually acquire it. A term first defined by _[Michael Porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter)_, could be summed up in a sentence:

> Sustainable competitive advantages are assets, attributes, or abilities that are difficult to duplicate or exceed; and provide a superior or favorable long term position over competitors.


And as a developer, even though tech is currently one of the most deficient skills one can possess, having basic knowledge often simply isn't enough to get the position you want, especially not in a top tier company in a big market. That's where the gap between the current school system and actual market needs is obvious. That's why having understanding of topics like:

> design patterns \
 software architectures \
 basic and advanced security principles \
 programming paradigms \
 deeper platform-specific knowledge 

comes into play. Possessing skills such as these, could be a difference between getting a life changing job or not. 
Coming from a small environment, with relatively undeveloped tech market, it was really hard acquiring knowledge necessary to move to a big market and work in one of the most security demanding areas of tech, which is eHealth .\
That's why the purpose of this blog is explaining knowledge on the above stated topics, which helped me transition to German market . No knowledge is perfect and finite but I will do my best to bring value, by going through new challenges, and documenting all  improvements and sharing the actual knowledge gained here.
