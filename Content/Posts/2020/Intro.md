# Intro 



As this is first post, I would like to headline my perspective on __`sustainable competitive advantage`__ in tech and how can one actually acquire it. A term first defined by _[Michael Porter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Porter)_, could be summed up in a sentence:

> Sustainable competitive advantages are assets, attributes, or abilities that are difficult to duplicate or exceed; and provide a superior or favorable long term position over competitors.


And as a developer, even though tech is currently one of the most deficient skills one can posses, having basic knowledge often simply isn't enough to get the position you want, especially not in a top tier company in a big market. That's where the gap between current school system and actual market needs is obvious. That's why having understanding of topics like:
```
design patterns 
software architectures 
basic and advanced security principles 
programming paradigms 
deeper platform-specific knowledge 
```
comes into play. Possessing skills such as these, could be a difference between getting a life changing job or not. \
Coming from a small environment, with relatively undeveloped tech market, it was really hard acquiring knowledge necessary to move to a big market and work in one of the most security demanding areas of tech, which is eHealth .\
That's why the purpose of this blog is explaining knowledges on above stated topics, which helped me land job in German market . My knowledge is growing on daily basis, by going through new challenges, and I will document all those improvements and try to share the actual knowledge gained here.
