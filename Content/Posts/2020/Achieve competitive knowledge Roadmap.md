# Achieve competitive advantage - **ROADMAP**


In case you understand basic programming concepts and possess basic knowledge, this is the right place to be. I will try to explain how I differentiated my knowledge and landed my first job in tech. If you are not sure about basic knowledge, please check one of my prior [posts](/posts/2020/Basic%20knowledge%20explained/).
When I started studying development in-depth a few years ago, all I had was huge software development is not up-to-date with big markets (e.g. Germany), it was really hard for me to find direction. Luckily for me, I met people who were willing to put in an amazing amount of effort to help me achieve my goals. So now, a couple of years later, I am part of a team that is working on an EHR/Health platform which requires a lot higher quality of output from me than my first jobs as a beginner did. 
I tried and helped developers who worked with me by taking them through this path and they have made amazing progress in their careers in a relatively short amount of time. Since it is impossible for me to keep helping people in 1on1 form, I will try to present you the path through a series of blog posts and help you achieve the same results.

I know this one looks **scary** at the first glance. Don't freak out. All resources are either out there already and you will be pointed to them, or I will write about them in future posts.

Gaining basic knowledge, even though it's just the beginning already seems hard enough. I provided resources I used before being taught these topics by more experienced developers.

I will try to take you through the path I have gone through and the path I'm still on. First thing you need to understand, before even starting this learning path is that your knowledge will never be enough and you will have to find a way to enjoy life-long learning if you want to be a truly successful software developer.

After gaining the basic knowledge, there are many paths to take. Usually this is part of the path where most young developers struggle and often end up learning stuff that is  not really commercially applicable.

So I divided my learning path at that point in my career into _six_ different areas:

* Design patterns 
* Advanced programming principles
* Secure development principles
* Version control - Git
* Soft skills
* Basic platform-specific knowledge

My first advice is to **never underestimate power of applicable theoretical knowledge.** What I mean by this is that not all theoretical knowledge is relevant, but one that is should never be skipped. I made this mistake and it slowed my learning process in many different areas.

Each of these topics is extensive, and I couldn't fit all relevant information into one article. First topic I will write a series on are **design patterns.** 

In the design patterns series I will cover topics like :

* Model View Controller  (MVC)
* Mode View ViewModel (MVVM)
* Basic of Model View Presenter (MVP)

I will explain the basic theoretical approach behind each of these, as well as pros and cons of each. At the end I will write an article to wrap up the series and help you understand why design patterns are **not enough** to make huge codebases extendable and sustainable.
