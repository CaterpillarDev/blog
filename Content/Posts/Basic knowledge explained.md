# Basic knowledge expained


As said in my first [post](/posts/2020/Intro/), landing first job in tech is not as easy as many people expect it to be. So first, let's try to understand how the process of achieving required knowledge works :

This one is pretty straightforward. The hard thing is **how**. Since requirement for achieving **competitive advantage** is having overall knowledge posses by most beginners I will try to explain my perception on basic knowledge. 

When it comes to programming, **basic knowledge** includes :

1. Variables, constants, data types
2. Flow control, functions
3. Objects and structures
4. Programming language syntax 
5. Additional tools 

When it comes to iOS and Swift, no source is as reliable as Apple documentation.
Overall, before starting anything, I advise trying to understand basic concepts of _object-oriented programming_. For understaning OOP consepts in depth I recommend this Stanford [course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KkMDCCdjyW8&list=PL47E7E3E9C3580684) which is free and available on youtube. Understanding OOP, even though it seems irrelevant at the beginning, will actually make your learning curve a lot less steep. I made this mistake, and I still regret it.

All above stated topics for iOS development are covered on Swift's [official website](https://swift.org).

After reading through the basic stuff, I would recommend using new app made by Apple which is super cool for learning basics. This app ,called **[Swift Playgrounds](https://apps.apple.com/de/app/swift-playgrounds/id1496833156?l=en&mt=12)**,  is available through the App Store and uses _games_ as a form of education for basic topics stated above. It requires no prior programming knowledge, so it si perfect for people just starting out.


In case you posses the basic knowledge, I highly recommend the _[Achieve competitive advantage roadmap]( /posts/2020/Achieve%20competitive%20knowledge%20Roadmap/)_ to start creating difference between you and others on the same path.
